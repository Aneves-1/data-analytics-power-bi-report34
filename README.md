# Data analytics power BI report

## Executive Summary:

Using Power BI and Power Query, I pulled data from 6 different sources (including Azure Cloud) and created a relational database model and a Microsoft Power BI report to monitor sales performance across the organisation. The 4-page report is interactive and filterable, and uses historical data from sales to track relevant KPIs and forecast their performance in the near future. 

I also created custom SQL queries to access the centralised Azure database from outside the Power BI environment.

The data presented here is from a fictitious company and has been fabricated. It is **NOT sensitive** data from real customers.

#### Power BI Report Preview
This interactive and comprehensive Power BI report contains four pages, including an Executive Summary, a Customer Detail Page, a Product Detail Page and a Stores Map.

## Business Problem:

A multinational retail company with multiple stores across the United Kingdomm, Germany and the US needs someone to build an end-to-end business intelligence solution from the ground up, using raw data containing information about sales, customers, products and store locations. 

My goals are to:
1. Design, build and deploy a Power BI interactive report to share across the organisation.
2. Create and automate SQL queries so clients can query the centralised database from outside the Power BI environment.

## The Solution:

### Methodology

1. **Data cleaning and centralisation** in Power BI. I loaded data from various sources to Power BI for data cleaning, transforming, modelling and analysis.


2. Build **Power BI report** containing 4 pages including an executive summary. The report is interactive and allows easy navigation and filtering.
3. Create SQL queries to answer client questions by pulling data from Azure database without the need for Power BI Service.
